Revision History
----------------
(Database updates happen with every release of NesToy.)

Version 1.1  - Everything that was broken in NesToy32 v1.0 should be fixed
               now.
             - Added -ips command line parameter.  Download and unzip the
               optional fixfiles archive from the NesToy page and NesToy
               can now automatically repair bad dumps to make them good.
             - You can now define the missing file in nestoy.cfg.  It now
               defaults to nes_miss.txt to avoid conflicts with GoodNES.
             - NesToy can now correctly detect NES ROMs with mapper #'s
               over 255. (To whoever defined these mappers, I strongly
               suggest changing them as mappers over 255 conflict with the
               VS Unisystem and Playchoice-10 bits in the NES header).

Version 1.0  - NesToy has been rewritten as a 32-bit console application
               and should run fine in Windows 9x/NT/2000.  You should also
               notice a nice speed increase and I will now be able to add
               zip support and possibly a GUI in the future.
             - Removed the command line option from NESTOY.CFG.  This may
               return in a later version.
             - Added NO_BACKUP to NESTOY.CFG.  Has the same effect as the
               -nobackup command line parameter when set to TRUE.
             - Added JOLIET to nestoy.cfg.  When set to TRUE, any game
               titles over 64 characters long will automatically use their
               short name.  This should help avoid any problems with burning
               the ROMs to a CD as the joliet standard limits file names to
               64 characters.  This feature is not perfected yet.
             - Missing file now defaults to NESMISS.TXT instead of
               MISSING.TXT.
             - Default options for -ren and -missing set in nestoy.cfg now
               work correctly when -doall is used.
