Revision History for 16-bit NesToy
----------------------------------

Version 4.0  - Significant changes have been made to the database structure.
               DO NOT try to use the database with previous versions of
               NesToy.  
             - The entire directory structure has been changed.  ROMs are
               now sorted by region.  Regions have been broken down into
               North America (USA/Canada), Japan, Europe, and Asia.
             - ROMs from specific countries in a region (not counting USA and
               Japan) will automatically have a country code attached.
             - The unlicensed directory has been removed.  Unlicensed ROMs
               are now sorted into their appropriate region directory and
               can be optionally sorted into an Unlicensed directory
               under that region.
             - A PD directory has been added for Freeware/Public Domain ROMs.
             - Added a directory "Other" for ROMs that are unclassified.
               Anything sorted into the "Other" directory needs to be
               classified and placed somewhere else.
             - -sub now scans directories 6 levels deep.
             - Added SORT_UNLICENSED to nestoy.cfg.  This determines whether
               unlicensed ROMs will be further sorted into an Unlicensed
               directory underneath their appropriate region directory.
             - Added TAG_UNLICENSED to nestoy.cfg.  Setting this to TRUE will
               attach an (Unl) to all unlicensed ROMs when renaming.
             - Many internal changes because of new database structure.
               Please report any bugs you may find, especially if they weren't
               there in previous versions of NesToy.
             - Pirate ROMs will now be tagged with (Pirate Cart) if they are
               known to have been dumped from an actual cartridge.  
             - All of the "Pirate Original" ROMs like Somari, Mortal Kombat 3,
               Street Fighter 3, etc. are currently in the "Other" directory.
               I currently have no idea where to place these.  The pirate
               directory is reserved for ROMs pirated from actual NES games
               so I do not want these there.
             - If a ROM has a ??? in the output listing instead of a country
               code, it is because I do not know where this ROM was released.
               If you know, please let me know!

Version 3.2  - Translations and Game Hacks will no longer show up in the
               missing list at all.  The options in nestoy.cfg to enable the
               displaying of them in the missing.txt file have been removed.
               I ask you to please read the documentation (nestoy.txt) for
               the reasons as to why I have done this.
             - (Rev #) has been changed back to (PRG #) when identifying
               ROM revisions by request.
             - Default options for -missing and -ren can now be set in 
               nestoy.cfg.
             - The [t] option has been removed from the -sort parameter and
               has been replaced by SORT_TRANS in nestoy.cfg.
             - Added DIR_PATCHES to nestoy.cfg.  Like DIR_SAVESTATES, When
               renaming ROMs, NesToy will now automatically rename any
               matching .PAT files it finds in this directory.
             - Removed the -hc parameter.  It is all but useless and has
               only caused confusion.

Version 3.1  - Some of the dupe checking code was broken a few releases back,
               causing ROMs to be flagged as dupes if for some reason they
               were scanned twice.  This has been fixed.
             - Replaced the (PRG # CHR #) with (Rev #) in the database for the
               appropriate ROMs.
             - You can now sort translations by language in the translation
               directory by using -sort[t].

Version 3.02 - Some database updates and a massive amount of japanese spelling
               corrections.
             - All translations are now named by the language they are
               translated into instead of just (Translated).

Version 3.01 - Enabled Windows 2000 support.  If you have any problems
               running NesToy under Windows 2000, or any bugs show up that
               weren't there before.  Let me know.

Version 3.0  - "Midnight Scan" bug should be fixed for good now.
             - Added SHORT_NAMES to nestoy.cfg.  This replaces the -sn
               parameter which has been removed.
             - If a ROM has the read-only attribute set, NesToy will remove
               it before scanning it.  This fixes the Runtime Error 005
               error some people have been getting.
             - Fixed a bug where NesToy was unable to rename a ROM if the
               filename was the same, but the case was different.
             - Added DIR_SAVESTATES to nestoy.cfg.  When renaming ROMs,
               NesToy will now automatically rename any matching .SAV and
               .ST* files it finds in this directory.
             - Large amount of spelling corrections in the database.  More
               coming soon.

Version 2.9  - Added DIR_BASE to nestoy.cfg.  This sets the base directory
               all the other directories will fall under.  If this is left
               blank, NesToy will behave as it did before and use the
               current directory as the base directory.  This is explained
               in detail in the documentation.
             - The maximum number of files per directory has been increased
               back up to 3500.
             - Fixed a bug where if NesToy began a scan before midnight, but
               finished after midnight, the time it took would display
               incorrectly at the end of the scan.
             - if -q is used in conjunction with -i, NesToy will
               work in quiet mode, but will display information on any ROMs
               that need repairing or renaming.
             - Added the [o] option to -q.  This will suppress output to
               the output file as well.
             - Removed the alternate -quiet option.  Only -q works now.

Version 2.82 - Massive database update.

Version 2.81 - Database update.  Please read the section in nestoy.txt under
               Mapper Information for new information concerning some mapper
               4 to 118 changes to several games.

Version 2.8  - Added -q,-quiet options to prevent NesToy from sending any
               output to the screen.

Version 2.7  - -sub now works correctly if you do not specify a directory
               on the command line. (It will scan the current directory and
               all directories under it.)
             - -res Now detects and resizes ROMs with extra, unused banks
               at the end of the ROM. (In other words, if the ROM header
               specifies that there are 8 PRG banks and 8 CHR banks, but the
               ROM contains 17 banks total, the extra banks will now be
               removed.)
             - -ren now has the option of placing periods in appropriate
               ROM names.  Example: Dr Mario.nes would be named
               Dr. Mario.nes.  Also periods will be used instead of
               underscores in the version #'s.  This naming scheme was
               purposely left out of earlier versions because Nesticle will
               not load a ROM if the filename has more than one '.' in it.
               This feature is enabled through -ren[p].
             - Fixed a bug where -ren[t] would do nothing if used with
               several of the other renaming options.
             - -sort now has a new command line option [m], which will
               sort the ROMs by mapper # under the appropriate country or
               type.

Version 2.6b - NesToy now uses date checking to insure a ROM doesn't get
               flagged as a duplicate if for some reason the same file gets
               scanned twice.
             - The entire database format has changed.  NesToy can now detect
               ROMS with bad CHR banks that are not in the database as long
               as a good dump of the ROM does exist in the database.
             - Removed ROMS with bad CHR banks from the database that are
               now identified automatically by NesToy.  Because of the
               database change, there are some bad dumps that were previously
               identified by NesToy that may not be now.  These will be
               added back into NesToy sometime in the future.
             - Temporarily reduced the maximum number of files per directory
               back down to 3000.  If there are more than 3000 files in one
               directory, NesToy will only scan 3000 of them.  After NesToy
               has sorted the directory, you can run NesToy again to finish
               up the rest of the ROMs.
             - Fixed a bug where NesToy would crash when creating a missing
               list if no ROMs are missing.

Version 2.5b - Massive database update
             - Finally fixed a moving/renaming problem that was causing
               extensions of (.ne1,.ne2, etc.) to appear on some files.
               You will still see these in the duplicate directory and the
               backup directory though.  This is normal.
             - Addad a -log option to log any problems NesToy encounters
               when renaming, sorting, or repairing ROMs.
             - NesToy now defaults to scanning the current directory if no
               pathname is specified on the command line.

Version 2.4b - Added a -nobackup option to suppress the creaton of backups
               when ROMs are repaired or resized.
             - NesToy can now resize some ROMs that are too small, but just
               need to be padded with empty space to repair them.
             - Fixed a bug where under certain circumstances, NesToy would
               be unable to perform a rename on ROMs if the were already
               sorted into the directories defined in nestoy.cfg.
             - Implemented a work-around to prevent NesToy from scanning the
               same ROM twice when -sub is used.  This caused NesToy to
               think the ROM was a duplicate and move it to the duplicates
               directory.  
             - NesToy will now always skip over the duplicate and backup
               directories in a scan unless they are specified directly on
               the command line.  This is not recommended.
             - All internal directory handling routines have been rewritten.
               Make sure to report any bugs or inconsistancies no matter how
               minor.
             - The backup directory can now be changed in nestoy.cfg.  Either
               delete nestoy.cfg and let it create a new one, or manually
               add the new entries.
             - Raised internal directory limit to 100 directories.
             - Small change in sorting routines.  ROMs with titles like
               "Dragon Warrior.nes" will now show up in the listings before
               "Dragon Warrior 2.nes."

Version 2.31b- Some people have been getting a Runtime Error 202 with
               version 2.3.  Should be fixed now.

Version 2.3b - NesToy can now automatically scan subdirectories under
               the directories specified on the command line by using the
               -sub command line option.
             - -ren now has the option to place the word "The" in
               appropriate ROMs at the beginning instead of the end of the
               filename.  NesToy also recognizes both variations of the
               name as correct.
             - Hacks are now split into 3 categories.  Mapper hacks, Game
               hacks, and hacks which don't fall into the other 2 categories.
             - Small internal changes to the database structure.  DO NOT
               try to run NesToy with a database from a previous version of
               NesToy.
             - Many internal changes, make sure to report any new bugs or
               existing ones.

Version 2.2b - Optimized CRC calculation routines resulting in a nice
               speed increase.
             - Support for Chinese ROMs.  Country code for China is now
               (C).  (F) is now used for the one Canadian ROM (French
               Canadian.)  Default directory for Chinese ROMs is China\.

Version 2.1b - Increased the maximum number of ROMs NesToy can read in
               one directory from 3000 to 4000.  Even though there are less
               than 2500 legitimate ROMs, some people seemed to have 3500+
               ROMs in one directory.  Wow!
             - When finished, NesToy will now tell you how long it took.
             - Changed the database file name to NESDBASE.DAT.

Version 2.0b - Fixed a bug where NesToy would not attach a country code
               to any canadian ROMs (which there is only one.)
             - Bad [] will now contain a "T", as shown in the docs, when a
               ROM contains trailing garbage instead of an "F".
             - The extended info line will now show Ren [] instead of
               Renamed, or Rep [] instead of Repaired.  This way, you can
               look inside the brackets and see why the rom needed to be
               fixed.
             - Fixed a bug in the missing.txt output routines.
             - You can now adjust in the nestoy.cfg, whether or not NesToy
               will include hacks, pirates, translations, or bad dumps when
               creating or updating the missing.txt file.
             - Added the [n] option to -missing.

Version 1.91b- Database update, replaced many bad dumps with good ones.

Version 1.9b - Added support for translations.
             - Added directory support to -sort for translations and
               pirates.
             - Pirates are defined as a ROM with the title or copyright
               information changed, defaced, or removed.  If any other
               changes have been made to the ROM, then it is a hack.
             - You can now specify whether or not bad dumps, pirates, or
               hacks will be moved into their own directories or into their
               corresponding country directory.
             - Fixed a bug thats been around for a while that would cause
               the missing.txt and output.txt files to fail to be created
               if you were in a directory with long pathnames.
             - Pressing ESC will now abort NesToy.  NesToy will stop on
               the ROM it is at and then quit.
             - Massive database update, make sure you delete you missing.txt
               and have NesToy create a new one or you may never know what
               is new.

Version 1.81b- Database update, fixed spelling on about 40 japanese ROMs.

Version 1.8b - Added -sn parameter.  When used, shorter file names will
               be used for some ROMs.  (Example: Instead of "Zelda 2 - The
               Adventure of Link.nes", the ROM will be named "Zelda 2.nes".)
             - Added extra options to -missing parameter. [c] will sort
               the missing.txt file by country codes and [b] will output
               the missing.txt with a bare format only (Name, checksum, and
               country codes)
             - Fixed a small bug that would cause a failure of the missing
               file to be created in a root directory or in some cases,
               at all.
             - -ren now has an option to rename ROMs to all
               lowercase names. (This feature was added by request)
             - You can now add command line parameters to the nestoy.cfg
               file.

Version 1.7b - When a MISSING.TXT file exists, NesToy will no longer
               overwrite it, but instead update it by removing ROMs that
               now exist.  Now you no longer have to scan your entire
               ROM collection every time you add a few new ROMs to update
               your missing file.
             - NesToy will now create a .cfg file (nestoy.cfg) the first
               time you run it.  You can customize the directories NesToy
               uses when moving around files in the .cfg file.
             - Directories with names like USA\, Japan\, etc. are now placed
               inside the current directory (The one you run NesToy from.)
               instead of under the directory where the ROM being moved is
               located.
             - NesToy will no longer try to move a file if the directory it
               originated from is the same directory it is being moved to.
               This caused a bunch of .NE1, .NE2, etc. files in previous
               releases when this was done.
             - A file with an extension like .NE1 or .BA1 is created when
               NesToy moves a file to a directory and a file with the same
               name already exists.  These should now only appear in the
               backup and duplicate directories.
             - ROMs moved to the duplicate directory are now renamed properly
               when moved.
             - You can now use -sort on a directory located on a CD-ROM
               drive (or any other unwriteable media) and it will sort the
               ROMs into directories and optionally rename them if renaming
               is active.  NesToy currently cannot repair the ROMs this way,
               but it will move any ROMs that need repairing into a directory
               called 'Repair\' in the current directory and you can then
               run NesToy a second time on this directory to finish the
               repair.  This will be fixed in a future release of NesToy.
             - Many other changes have been made to improve the way NesToy
               handles the moving of ROMs.
             - Received a nice list of japanese spelling errors and fixes
               which have been incorporated into the database.  I accidentally
               deleted the e-mail so I have no idea who to give credit to.
               Sorry.

Version 1.6b - The database now includes known bad dumps.  When using
               -sort, these ROMs will be moved into a directory called
               BAD.  Bad dumps will not show up on your missing list
               when using -missing.
             - A bad dump is now indicated by a 'b' in the far left
               column in a ROM listing.
             - Database format has been altered slightly to allow for ROM
               entries with additional resize information when needed.  

Version 1.5b - Fixed a small bug when NesToy would rename a file with the
               same name, but different case.
             - Added the -doall parameter.
             - Added internal resize support for a handful of ROMs that
               need resizing, but not because of duplicate data.
             - -missing now automatically turns on -c.  This should fix
               the problem some of you have been having with -missing
               reporting all ROMs as being missing.
             - Revision history is now in WHATSNEW.TXT instead of the
               main documentation.

Version 1.4b - -res,-resize parameter added.  Unknown ROMs will now be
               checked for duplicate data and resized if necessary.

Version 1.3b - Lots of Error checking added.  NesToy no longer goes crazy
               when unable to create a file or when trying to rename or
               repair ROMs on a read-only device like a CD-ROM drive.
             - NesToy will now automatically add a country code to a ROM
               when renaming if a file already exists in the directory with
               that name.
             - Fixed a major bug in the Long File Name handling routines
               which would cause NesToy to freeze up once in a while for no
               apparent reason.

Version 1.2b - Fixed incorrect detection of ROMS with trainers present
             - Fixed a stupid stupid mistake.  It seems after NesToy found
               a duplicate ROM, it would flag every ROM after that as a
               duplicate.  This has been fixed.  I forgot to reset the flag
               for each ROM.

Version 1.1b - Added -missing parameter
             - Added -sort parameter
             - Output is now sorted alphabetically
             - Number of pathnames on command line have been increased from
               8 to 12.
             - All backups are automatically put into a directory called
               BACKUP in the directory where the ROM is located
             - All duplicates are automatically put into a directory called
               DUPES in the directory where the ROM is located

Version 1.0b - Changed -f parameter to -o, you can now specify a file
               to output to, if no file is specified, it defaults to
               OUTPUT.TXT.
             - Changed -s parameter to -f
             - Added option to add country codes when renaming
             - Added option to remove spaces from filenames with renaming
             - Removed the -t option, filenames too large to fit on one
               line will wrap around to the next line
             - NesToy will no longer flag your ROM as incorrectly named if
               you are using a different name scheme from the default.
               In other words, previously, if you chose to use underscores
               instead of spaces in your ROM names, NesToy would flag these
               ROMs are being named wrong, it now recognizes all combinations
               of name schemes.
             - Work in progress to automatically sort your ROMs into
               directories.  This is not enabled yet, the routines involve
               moving files around and I want to make sure they are 100%
               reliable and bug-free before I enable them.
